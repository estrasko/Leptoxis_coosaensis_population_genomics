### STACKS populations

# run populations with the --radpainter flag, use multiple SNPs per locus

### RADpainter

# navigate within multiple SNPs per locus directory, then run:

RADpainter paint populations.haps.radpainter

# this is already within the path on the server I used (Shoals)

### fineRADstructure

# now cluster the individuals using mcmc
